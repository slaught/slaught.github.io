## warnings
There is no part 1 yet. It is a longer conversation to get started. So I am
jumping into the part where I am at. Confusion is to be expected.


## Metaphor & Unified Concept
Trying to develop a UI for developers tied in with Rubinius. There are many
ideas, goals, tasks and activities. But there is no Unified Concept nor
Metaphor. While it may be possible to proceed without it, I do not think we
will have useful output without one.

[Brian](http://brixen.github.io) and I had been discussing the Developer UI
for the last couple of months.  

I read a [post by someone about something](http://nearthespeedoflight.com/article/2014_03_17_objective_next). 
He was asking for a sucessor to _Objective C_. I liked the premise of
_Objective C_. I love the language _Smalltalk_ and I love assembler _C_. So I
read the article. There is a kernel of an idea in there. There is also alot of
crap and bad use of language. If he wants to get people to think differently
he must be precise with his word choice. For it is the assumptions around word
usage and choice that leads the problems he is trying to break.

Anyways, his idea of turning color's encoded as hex values into the actual
colrs on a bitmap display hit a note. It was not that strong of a note as me
and Brian had already being talking about how do we integrate a backtrace in
the text editor for the relevant source text.
