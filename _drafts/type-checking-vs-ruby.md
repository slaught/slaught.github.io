## Prehistory

Static Type checking and type inference systems have been all the rage for the
last serveral years. [1] 

The first programming language I learned on my own was Smalltalk and C. I
learned both of them the same summer. I enjoyed both languages for their
minimalism. 


Ruby is a dynamic typed language. 








## References
1 There exists an article on the increase of type checking and other aspects
of languages development but I can't find it right now. I could have imagined
the whole thing.
