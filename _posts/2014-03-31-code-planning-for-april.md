I am working on a plan of things I want to work on in April. I have
several ideas but none are really exciting. But I want to try to write
some code each day. 

This weekend I was writing scripts for this blog. I might turn this into
a script or a standalone program. I wrote something for livejournal way
back in the day. I am not sure where that code is. I should find it. I
am almost positive I was doing something with drafts. Jekyll seems to
support drafts but no interface besides the filesystem. 

### Possible Coding
* Ruby Date, Time, DateTime class rewrite
* Ruby Socket class rewrite
* Debianize rbx 1.3. This is already mostly done. Need to do a PR.
* Stats display and gathering of GC
* Enki Cloud v4
* Enki to rbx
* blog scripts

As I work on pieces I'll do a writeup of what I am doing and why.
