# Use Cases for Developers

This is basic data for creating a new UI for developers. We are considering Expert Systems and Problem Solving  UIs are a starting point.

## Basic Personas
* Beginner
* Intermediate
* Expert
* 

### Questions

These were the considerations we were going to use for developing personas:

* Who exactly are we designing for? (beyond just developers)
* What are there motivations for using the "tool" 
* What are there goals with the "tool" 
* What are their fears, frustrations, and major pain points (with similar applications or systems in general) 
* Where do they currently go to seek information

#### Things to keep in mind: 
* Amount of content consumed at different stages of the application process 
* Driving factors and pain points that lead to sustained product use 
* Most common objections to the product (perceived barriers)
