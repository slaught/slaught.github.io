## Introductions 
This is my first post. I had to write something to test out this software
stack. I also need a place to put together some various thoughts that are
floating around. Most of my work is within the company I work for but that is
changing. I need to work with people who are working with or for me. 

## Caveats
As a visual person, my office whiteboard is the most useful medium of
conversation. I am still working on the best way to create and publish my
whiteboard work. 

## Topics
I will be writing about a couple of topics that interest me.  Programming
Languages, Human Computer Interaction(HCI), Software Development and Organizational
Theory.

## HCI
I prefer HCI to the ACM ordering, CHI. As I live in Chicago which is often
abbrevated as CHI, the distinction matters. I also think that Humans are the
key component of HCI and by putting it first we focus on what is important.
