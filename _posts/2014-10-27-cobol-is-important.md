The reason I always bring up Cobol is because whatever theory on language
usage, features, and expressiveness that I evaluate must explain why people 
use COBOL. 

I have lots of reasons why people might use it but none of them are
satisfactory to me. 

I think McCarthy, Backus and Hopper were on to something. I think Wirth and
Dijkstra had good criticism for what they created and some new ideas. But I think Ritchie, Bentley 
and Thompson showed those ideas have practical problems. 

I know I used an OS builder and non-language designer at the end. Thompson's
use of C in Unix is important. Bentley because he demonstrated problems with
Pascal for expressiveness and two of his students went on to create important langauges, TCL & Java.
