I am installing a new OS on my macbook. I have had this macbook for
about 3 years. I bought it from work. It was easier than paying for a
new one. I was hoping to get a Lion install disk but no luck. I hate
people who take the Disc out of the box, give you the box, then throw
out the disc. why?

Anyways, I downloaded Mavericks last night and started formatting a USB
drive. Making a bootable USB drive was not that difficult but stupid
process that had to be followed. Why are the dmg marked as hidden in the
first place? No one will look inside the contents but people trying to
fix something and the hidden flag makes it more difficult than
necessary.

After that it boots and installs ok. Now to install all the shit I need
to work.

I have some basic tools which need to be installed. But I found out
Mavericks includes an older version of git. Nice on one hand and fucking
annoying on the other. The concept of basic tools with the OS is good.
The annoying part is not being able to uninstall the shit.

I am just reminded why I just wanted Lion installed and could restore my
settings and at least get back to work. But no, wasting hours
downloading shit. I should be back up by tomorrow.
