## Until that day

This is what I wrote about my last day at Enova.

This is my last day at Enova. It has been 2453 days since I started. I
have been trying to think of something funny to write but I am not
funny. I can only express my sincere appreciation for having the
chance to work with an incredible group of smart, creative and hard
working people. Everyone here has made me a better person and a better
professional. I am very thankful to you all.


### Meditation XVII by John Donne

<pre>
No man is an island,
Entire of itself,
Every man is a piece of the continent,
A part of the main.
If a clod be washed away by the sea,
Europe is the less.
As well as if a promontory were.
As well as if a manor of thy friend's
Or of thine own were:
Any man's death diminishes me,
Because I am involved in mankind,
And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;
It tolls for thee.
</pre>


Thank you,
